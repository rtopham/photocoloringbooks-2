        .
      </p>
      <h5> 4. General Payment Terms</h5>
      <p>
        Premium features of the Service will require you to pay fees upon
        registering for the applicable premium service. Before you pay any fees,
        you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will
        be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Fees
        may vary based on the plan.
      </p>
      <h5> 4.1 Price</h5>
      <p>
        We reserve the exclusive right to determine pricing for the Service. We
        will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on
        the website up to date. We may change the fees for any feature of the
        Service, including additional fees or charges, if we give you advance
        notice of changes before they apply. In our sole discretion, we may make
        promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any
        of our customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not
        apply to your offer or these Terms.
      </p>
      <h5> 4.2 Authorization</h5>
      <p>
        You authorize us to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any
        level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by
        us, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees
        with a credit card, we may seek pre-authorization of your credit card
        account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid
        and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.
      </p>
      <h5> 4.3 Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy</h5>
      <p>
        Subscriptions typically end at the end of the subscription period and
        are not automatically renewewd. You will only be charged again if you
        choose to renew your subscription. However, we may offer other types of
        subscriptions that do automatically renew at the end of a subscription
        period, with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (a
        “Recurring Subscription Service”). If you activate a Recurring
        Subscription Service with recurring payments, you authorize us to
        periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancelation of
        either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or
        before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription
        Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first Recurring
        Subscription Service, if applicable. If you purchase a Recurring
        Subsription Service, your account will be charged automatically on the
        Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription
        period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your
        subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your Recurring
        Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the
        next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the
        periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during
        registration (or to a different payment method if you change your
        payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by
        accessing your account settings. When your Subscription Service ends,
        your account will remain and you can continue to access your pages and
        coloring books. However, you will need to renew your subscription to
        continue using PDF features and maintain add-free access to your pages
        and books. You can purchase a new subscription at any time without
        opening a new account, although the subscription fees may have
        increased. You can delete your account at any time. If you delete your
        account, you will no longer have access to the customer data, pages and
        books associated with that account, and you will not be able to purchase
        a new subscription unless you create a new account.
      </p>
      <h5> 4.4 Free Trials</h5>
      <p>
        Your access to the Service may start with a free trial subscription for
        premium features. The free trial period for any subscription will last
        for the period of time specified when you signed up or were otheriwse
        offered a free trial. If you begin your subscription with a free trial,
        we will begin charging you automatically the applicable Subscription Fee
        at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you
        cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial period. Your
        payment method will be authorized for an initial subscription payment as
        soon as you register for a free trial. In some instances, your available
        balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization;
        however, no charges will be made against the payment method if you
        cancel prior to the end of your free trial period.
      </p>
      <h5> 4.5 Delinquent Accounts</h5>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any account for
        which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for
        the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges
        that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid
        amount, including collection fees.

        SINGLETRACK ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
        THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR
        OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS
        LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO SINGLETRACK
        VENTURES FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO

      </p>
      <p>
        EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED
        TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.
        THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
        BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND
        INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN
        THIS SECTION 12 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS
        ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

      <h5>13 General Terms</h5>
      <p>
        These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements
        expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and
        exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Singletrack
        Ventures regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or
        transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in
        part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
        consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or
        consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not
        affect our right to require performance at any other time after that,
        nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any
        provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or
        default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in
        these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the
        interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the
        word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of
        these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable
        part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the
        remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <h5>13.1 Governing Law</h5>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard
        to conflict of law principles. You and Singletrack Ventures submit to
        the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal
        courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for resolution of any
        lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.
      </p>
      <h5>13.2 Consent to Electronic Communications</h5>
      <p>
        By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic
        communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy.
        Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic
        communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements,
        disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically
        will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those
        communications be in writing.
